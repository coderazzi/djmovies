Locations sync
==============

In DJ, locations are not fixed. If it is a hard disk, it could be mounted on different locations, 
	depending on computer, OS. 
To synchronize a location, the user must always enter the associated physical path 
	(this can be facilitated later on).
Synchronization handles all files in the given location, but is not a recursive process: it only handles
	top files, and top folders containing single movie files. Folders are required for expanded formats
	(like DVD or BlueRay), and can be used with any format in case there are subtitle files associated.
On synchronization, DJ detects:
	M1- Movie exists in DB and in filesystem.
		It allows to EDIT the information, looking again in IMDB.
		It allows full control of subtitles, as detailed below.
	M2- Movie exists in DB but not in filesystem.
		Subtitles, if any are not shown.
		User can remove the movie from the given location.
	M3- Movie exists in filesystem but not in database,
		User can add the movie to database using information from IMDB
		Once the movie is included in database, full subtitles handling is supported
Handling the subtitles, is possible:
	S1- Add new subtitles (looking into pseudo IMDB locations).
	S2- Add new subtitles from locations?
	S3- If subtitle exists in database but no in filesystem, can be removed from DB
	S4- Edit a subtitle (select language, normalize filename)

	Edit / Remove are mutually incompatible. Remove will appear in red.

	If a movie is not yet inserted in DB, no subtitles are shown
